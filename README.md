# reaction-aggregator

`reaction-aggregator` is the **Aggregate** step of a biometric-reaction analytics pipeline (neuromarketing). Test viewers watch ad creatives; an upstream system (Hume-style expression measurement) scores their facial and vocal emotional reactions over time, producing a raw reaction — roughly 48 expression scores per timestamp per channel. This service reads those already-scored reactions from an OLTP source, transforms them, and loads a queryable star-schema warehouse (OLAP).

The unit of work is one session — one viewer watching one creative. The system runs as a batch ETL job, one job per session.

## How to run

Everything runs in Docker — no local Python setup. The local stack is three Compose services sharing a `./data` volume: a one-shot `aggregate` job (the pipeline), a one-shot `seed` job (deterministic synthetic source data), and a long-running `jupyter` service.

### Quick start

```bash
just seed        # generate synthetic source data (default: a fixed uuid5 session id)
just run         # run the pipeline for the seeded session
just notebook    # review the warehouse in JupyterLab on http://localhost:8888 (token disabled — local demo only)
just test        # full pytest suite + coverage gate, inside the container
just reset       # wipe all data and re-seed the default session
```

`seed` and `run` take an optional session id (`just run my-session`). Every recipe is a thin wrapper over Compose — `just run my-session` = `docker compose run --build --rm aggregate my-session`.

Each seeded session is one viewer watching one creative, both drawn deterministically from small fixed pools — seed and run a few sessions to give the notebook's viewer-attribute breakdowns and cross-creative comparisons something to compare.

### Notes

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SOURCE_DATABASE_PATH` | `data/source.db` | Path to the SQLite source database |
| `WAREHOUSE_DATABASE_PATH` | `data/warehouse.duckdb` | Path to the DuckDB warehouse file |

- **DuckDB is single-writer**: one read-write connection or many read-only ones. If `just run` fails with `IO Error: Could not set lock`, another process has the warehouse open — restart the notebook kernel (or stop `just notebook`) and run one job at a time.
- The containers run as root, so files under the bind-mounted `./data` are root-owned on the host; `just reset` may need `sudo` on Linux.

## How to extend: adding a dimension

1. **Entity and mapping** — add the entity to `app/domain/models.py` and create `app/domain/mappings/<name>.py` with a `Mapping` subclass implementing `extract` and `transform`.
2. **Source label and query** — add the label to `SourceDescriptor` in `app/domain/ports/source.py`; serve it from the source adapters: one parameterized query in `SQLiteSource`'s query map, one dict entry in `MockSource` seeds in tests.
3. **Registry** — append the mapping to `REGISTRY` in `app/application/registry.py`.
4. **Seeder** — add the table and synthetic rows to `app/seed.py` so the local stack serves the new label.

The warehouse needs no change — `DuckDBWarehouse` derives each table's schema from the entity's fields and creates it inside the load transaction.
